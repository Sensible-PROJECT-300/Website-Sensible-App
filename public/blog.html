                                    We had our first meeting as a group of two today. 
                                    We are still waiting to hear back from Keith about adding another team member. 
                                    We discussed with our supervisor the basic idea behind our app and what features 
                                    we were thinking of including, as well the technology we may use. We thought Xamarin 
                                    would be a good option, because we had already done a lot of work with C#, so felt quite 
                                    confident in using it. Gabrielle created a Trello page for our group so we can organise team 
                                    work and keep track of our deadlines.

                                    We met with our supervisor this week to discuss how we are going to set up the project and delegate tasks. Gabrielle set up the Trello board that we will be using to keep track of our work and progress. She also received a licence key from Mary to evaluate Invision as a wireframe tool.
                                    Karl did research on starter Xamarin projects/tutorials and contacted Keith about advice and help.
                                    The team also investigated the feasibility of exporting banking data to a CSV file using Machine Learning and Gabrielle contacted a lecturer for some advice regarding this.

                               The team with our supervisor met to discuss our next steps. 
                               Karl offered to do some research on financial data laws. He also looked up Udemy courses and YouTube tutorials on Xamarin.
                               Maria did extensive research on Machine Learning and Image/Text Recognition and Gabrielle started work on the Wireframes for the app using Adobe XD.

                                The team sat down with our Supervisor and ran through how we hope to present our app. We are focusing on important features and how we split work within the group. We have decided that Gabrielle will introduce the app and run through the basic idea behind it, Karl will then show the code and how he plans to impliment our other features, then Gabrielle will discuss the design and the wireframes. After this, Maria will talk about the research that was conducted for the app, as well as discuss her part in the design process which includes the logo for the app. Karl will then demo the app.
                                We plan to showcase our work using slides, which will also show wireframes. The team is excited for the presentation and is looking forward to advice from the lecturers.

                                    The team had our Interim Presentation in front of the panel of lecturers today. The moral of the group was good, and we felt confident. However, we ran into an issue shortly before the presentation where the app would not deploy on our Android device and we unfortunately could not use it in the demo. 
                                    We did, however, try our best to deliver a presentation that showcased our app and our ideas behind the project. We felt that it was well received and were happy with the outcome.

                                    The team have resumed with work after the Christmas break and met to discuss how to continue with the project. We have run into some issues using Xamarin and wanted to be clear on what our other options are. We set a deadline for the end of this week to have some functionality/pages working. We also discussed the possibility that we may not be able to continue with Xamarin as an IDE. Angular, React Native and Android Studio were other IDEs that were agreed on as alternatives. We concluded that React and Android Studio have quite a steep learning curve, so they may not be an option, however we would still look into them. 
                                    For this week, we have broken up work as follows: 
                                    Karl will continue to work on the Xamarin code to figure out if it is feasible for us to continue using Xamarin.
                                    Maria will do some research into React Native and try to get a couple of pages working to see if it is a possibility to use React.
                                    Gabrielle will continue working on an Angular alternative to work out how viable it is to continue the project by switching to the Angular Framework.
                                    The group has agreed to meet again with our supervisor this week on the 24th to discuss our work and make decisions on how to move forward with the project.

                                    The team met with our supervisor to discuss our progress and work that we had completed. Maria stated that she was enjoying using React and found the styling much simpler than Xamarin. Karl is still working on the Xamarin code and is slowly adding code to allow the functionality of the database.

                                    The team decided to look at our other IDE options for the app, as we are having
                                    some issues with Xamarin. Maria and Gabrielle are looking into a React Native app
                                    which we could use as a backup if Xamarin continues to have issues, and are both
                                    using a Udemy course as a guide mostly because we have never worked with the
                                    react library before and are unsure how to replicate our Xamarin project using this.
                                    We will meet again on Friday to discuss our progress.

                                    The team met to discuss our project, as we had planned at the start of the week. We had delegated work for this week as follows:
                                    Both Maria and Gabrielle would work on replicating our app using React Native, as a back-up in the event we could not fix the issues we were experiencing with Xamarin.
                                    Karl would continue to work on the Xamarin project and try to get it to a stage where we could use it without major issues impeding us.
                                    We had completed the work we had discussed and discussed how we should proceed. Maria had made strides with the React app, but Gabrielle had some issues with it. Karl had fixed most of the problems with Xamarin. We discussed whether or not we should continue with Xamarin or React. 
                                    Our thoughts on each are as follows:
                                    Our Xamarin app was closer to being finished and the financial inputs working. All that remains to do is setup the database and design the pages.
                                    The React Native app, style wise, looked better than the Xamarin one now. This was mostly because the core features we needed in Xamarin were either being worked on or just finished, which left little time in the beginning for us to style it. We decided that this was an easily fixed issue and should not cloud our judgement on using Xamarin over React Native. 
                                    The group decided that although we felt that Xamarin was still the way forward, we would continue to work on both the Xamarin and React native apps until our next meeting, so that we would have a definitive gage of both and that would make our decision much easier.

                                    The focus of this meeting for the team was to update each other on our progress with both the Xamarin app and React Native app. Gabrielle tried to fix the npm issues she was experiencing with React but found the error was too great and would greatly impede on the groups work to continue with React. 
                                    The team decided that we would continue to use Xamarin as our main app.

                                    During our meeting today Maria emailed our supervisor to enquire about the poster spec requirements. We discussed working on the poster and drew out a basic diagram on the board to highlight our ideas. Maria began working on the poster using Adobe Photoshop and Gabrielle worked on getting a calendar implemented in our app.

                                    The team met to discuss our progress. Our supervisor was unavailable to meet with us, so we discussed within the group our progress and thoughts on the poster. We encountered some issues with the project this week and tried to come to a conclusion on how to fix these problems; There was an issue with data concurrency within the database that Karl eventually solved with the help of a lecturer and Maria and Gabrielle had an issue with running the emulator in visual studio. This problem occurred because in order to run the emulator, Hyper-V needs to be installed on the machine. However, Hyper-V cannot be installed without having a windows pro/enterprise or education package as of 2019. We’re not sure how, but Karl’s emulator works. So, our only option right now to fix this issue is to either push our code to GitHub and view changes on Karl’s machine or focus on other aspects of the project such as the documentation or work on our website. Maria began work on our website, which we wanted to use as a basic landing page that explained the app and gave a download link to the app using an AWS S3 Bucket.
                                    Gabrielle also finished the user survey and showed the group the form:

                                    The team held a meeting today to discuss updates. Maria had an appointment to
                                    attend to so was unavailable to meet in person, but had informed us of her progress
                                    with the Website. She completed the website and we agreed it was of a very high
                                    standard and suited our app well.
                                    Gabrielle continued to work on the documentation for the project and on the code for
                                    the calendar. 
                                    Karl continued to work on the main code of the app.

                                    The team met with our supervisor to discuss preparations for a mock demo of the
                                    App; we decided on the 24th as the date for this. Gabrielle is still working on the 
                                    proposal document, Karl is finishing the code and Maria is working on the poster and 
                                    website. Gabrielle has the text for the blog and will update once the website is 
                                    complete and push the changes to GitHub. 
                                    We discussed with our supervisor the possibility of sending out our survey for some 
                                    user feedback regarding student financial management. Our supervisor informed us 
                                    that she thought it would be wise to instead present this to a group of first years who 
                                    could fill out the survey in class. 
                                    We also discussed the poster and felt Maria did a fantastic job on getting our point 
                                    across. It was informative but also had eye catching illustrations.
                                    The team is going to continue working on their individual aspects of the project. Maria will finish the website and deploy it to firebase. Karl will complete the app and design the user interface, and Gabrielle is going to complete the proposal document and the team blog and do the unit testing of the app once it is finished.
