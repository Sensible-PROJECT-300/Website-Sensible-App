# Website-Sensible-App
This is the website for our application: https://sensible-website.firebaseapp.com/index.html

We decided to create a website with two main parts.
   - First part of the website is for our users or potential users. They can find there more information and also a link for downloading the app. 
   - The second part is our project blog, where we added a summary of our meetings, since October.
